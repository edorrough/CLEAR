              <p>
                CARLA is a comprehensive personalized reading intervention
                system (B Wise, S Van Vuuren, N Ngampatipatpong, with funding
                from NIH; grounded on earlier programs (ROSS and FtL) funded by
                NIH, IES, & an IERI). CARLA integrates all 5 domains of
                evidence-based reading instruction, gradually changing its
                balance of thoughtful instruction from more time in engaging
                activities for earlier readers to more time in books as readers
                progress. Its fidelity of treatment makes it a great platform
                for studying what works best for children with different
                cognitive profiles.

              <p>
                In PropBank, we identify the arguments of predicates (e.g.
                verbs, eventive nouns) and label them with semantic roles that
                show their relationship to the predicate. The semantic arguments
                of the verb are labeled on a verb-by-verb basis, creating a
                separate frame file that includes verb specific semantic roles
                to account for each subcategorization frame of the verb. It has
                been shown that training supervised systems with PropBankâ€™s
                semantic roles for shallow semantic analysis yields good results
                (see CoNLL 2005 and 2008). PropBank currently includes four
                language projects: English, Chinese, Hindi/Urdu, and Arabic.
