            content_content: "The Departments of Linguistics and Computer Science have teamed up to jointly offer an interdisciplinary degree, the Computational Linguistics, Analytics, Search and Informatics Professional Master’s Degree (CLASIC), approved by the University of Colorado Board of Regents in April 2016.  Professor Martha Palmer, who holds a joint appointment in the two departments, developed the program. She and Professor Jim Martin (Computer Science) direct the program. CLASIC, a stand-alone Professional Master of Science degree, provides students with a solid foundation in both linguistics and computer science graduate course work as well as several courses focused on date-driven linguistics, computational linguistics, and information processing. Graduates of the program will be specialists in the application of computers to the processing of natural languages, such as English, Chinese, Arabic and Urdu. The field of computational linguistics, also known as text analytics, natural language processing, and informatics, is burgeoning and has become critical to the success of mainstream global businesses who compete for employees qualified to address these needs. The interdisciplinary nature of CLASIC is a significant market strength because success in this developing field of natural language processing requires a strong background in both Linguistics and Computer Science. The training will prepare students for careers in predictive text messaging, search engines, question-answering, interactive virtual agents and machine translation. ",

            content_content: "The small scale of the Linguistics major ensures close peer relationships and extensive interaction with faculty members, many of whom actively engage students in their research. There are currently about 150 students taking a Major or Minor in Linguistics. The most dedicated and talented students may elect to enter the five-year joint BA/MA degree in Linguistics or to pursue an Honors thesis. Language is something that we have and something that we do. It is a fundamental part of the human experience and indispensible to human progress. Language is a cultural and interactive tool and it is also a major part of the way we think and reason.  To study the language faculty requires you to study everything from the way we form sounds and gestures, to the way we perceive speech, to the meanings that language expresses, to the use of language as a signal of group identity. All of these topics are encompassed by coursework in the major. The Linguistics department gives its majors the experience of an academic neighborhood—something that few other CU departments can do. At present, there are about 160 students working toward a Major or Minor degree in Linguistics at CU Boulder. Because of the small scale of the major and a faculty dedicated to teaching excellence, Linguistics majors can interact extensively with peers and instructors both inside and outside the classroom. Because the Linguistics major has relatively few course requirements (27 credits in Linguistics plus 5 credits of a natural language other than English), it can easily be combined with electives, a minor or a double major in another field that interests you. Among the areas of study that you can insightfully integrate with linguistics are: Anthropology, International Affairs, Communication, Theatre, Speech, Language and Hearing Science, Cognitive Science, Computer Science, Education, modern languages, Philosophy, Classics and Sociology.",

The program also helps students determine in a relatively short time whether they want to make research in linguistics a lifelong career and prepares students who decide to do so to apply to the PhD program at CU or at other institutions. The main component of the MA program is 30 semester hours of courses (at least 24 of them in linguistics). Students may also choose to write an MA thesis. Students on both the thesis plan and non-thesis plan must take and pass the comprehensive exam in the third or fourth semester of study in order to receive the MA degree. By meeting additional requirements, MA students may also obtain the MA with a certificate in Cognitive Science,  Human Language Technology, TESOL, or Culture, Language and Social Practice.",

            content_content: "The doctoral program emphasizes the early involvement of all students in research, so students entering the PhD program should be prepared to work actively to define their research interests in consultation with faculty and to declare their area of specialization early in their studies. It is always possible to change specialization, although this may prolong the time needed to complete the program. Bear in mind that it is increasingly critical for those aiming for an academic or industry career to begin building a curriculum vitae (CV) at an early stage of the doctoral program. This means not only constructing the CV, or academic resume, according to the standard template, but also producing professional-level research products that you can include on that CV. These products range from conference presentations and posters to journal articles. The sooner you can define your research program, the more quickly you can begin to build your CV.",

Engineers like to build things, creating prototypes that might solve a particular problem, and then iterating on the design until it's just right. The BS degree program emphasizes knowledge and awareness of computing at all levels, from circuits and computer architecture through operating systems and programming languages to large application systems; the theoretical and mathematical aspects of computing; the interdependence of hardware and software; and the challenge of large-scale software production and the engineering principles used to meet that challenge. As a BS student, you will complete a wide breadth of CS courses, a strong foundation in mathematics, and a required senior project or senior thesis.",

Research-based vs. Course-based Master's, if you’re trying to decide between these two programs, here are a few main points of differentiation: Research-based MS students can move into the PhD program more easily. A thesis option and independent study research options are available for the research-based MS, but not for a course-based MS. More research opportunities are available to research-based MS students. Various sub-plan options are available for course-based MS students. Course-based (professional) MS students are not eligible for part-time instructor positions, or for teaching or research assistantships – only hourly appointments.
